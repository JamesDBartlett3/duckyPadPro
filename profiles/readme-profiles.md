# Profiles

This directory contains duckyScript profiles for the duckyPad Pro device.

## Structure

Each profile should be organized in its own subdirectory with the following structure:

```
profile-name/
├── config.txt       # Profile configuration
├── key1.txt         # duckyScript for key 1
├── key2.txt         # duckyScript for key 2
├── ...
└── README.md        # Description of the profile
```

## Creating a Profile

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Add duckyScript files for each key you want to program
3. Add a `config.txt` file with profile settings
4. Include a README.md describing the profile's purpose and usage
