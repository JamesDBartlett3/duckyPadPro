# readme-workbench

## Overview

The `workbench/` directory serves as a sandbox environment for testing and developing duckyScript profiles and helper utilities. It provides a structured space to experiment with new scripts, validate functionality, and refine workflows before deploying them to your duckyPad Pro device.

## Structure

```
workbench/
├── profiles/          # Profiles under development
```

## Developing Profiles

The `profiles/` subdirectory contains profiles that are actively being developed and tested. Profiles may be compiled and validated using the helper scripts located in the `helpers/` directory.
